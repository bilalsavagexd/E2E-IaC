# E2E-IaC
End-to-End Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, AWS, Docker, and Git

## Overview
In this project I will design, implement, and manage a complete DevOps pipeline utilizing ``Terraform``, ``AWS``, ``Docker``, ``Git``, ``GitHub``, and ``GitBash``. 

I will establish an AWS VPC, deploy a Dockerized application on an EC2 instance, and automate the entire process using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

This Project shows my comprehension of ``DevOps principles``, ``cloud infrastructure management``, ``containerization``, and ``version control``.
